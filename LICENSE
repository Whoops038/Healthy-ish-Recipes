How You Would Suffer Damage From Using This Software:

"Oh wow! This software is so fun" you're thinking
As the guitar of peanut butter you're eating
Gets closer and closer to the edge of your bed
Every time you eat from the guitar
Since the fork your eating with is stuck to your head
So the added weight moves it far

Crash! The guitar does fall
Breaking into many pieces small
Perhaps having your bed be 200 metres tall
Had been a horrible mistake to make
So, the appropriate steps you take

Jumping off the bed you perform a routine
With such grace, a divine scene
Triple front flip, triple back-flip
1 1/2 twist into a middle split
You contort into the shape of a ship
You are amazing, you are IT

You realize you're approaching the sharp broken mess
You try to avoid it but you --- DO?!
You land on your feet, getting over the stress
You jump in excitement, which causes you to

Slip on butter you forgot about,
Slide into your bowl of trout
Slip on the creature,
Slide on its water,
Slip on some peanut butter

And land your arse on top of there
Which lie the broken shards
You suffering from this software
Was always in the cards
